			<p>One of Evergreen Brand Builders first brands was developed in-house. The #Hashtagz<sup>tm</sup> brand was developed to be used for cannabis accessories along with edible products. Today, most edibles offer little to no brand recognition. Because of this, there is no product differentiation in the market, retailers face downward price pressure, there is no consistency in end-customer experience and customers have a buying experience that is sub-par. #Hashtagz<sup>tm</sup> solves this problem in a variety of ways. One, the shape of the product is internationally known and immediately differentiates itself from other edible products on the shelf. Two, hash oil-infused edibles coupled with product layout tie together a feature/shape fit. Third, marketing capabilities are abundant when tying in the # to social media efforts.</p>
